My goal in creating yet another DS1307 library was to provide
easy access to some of the other functions I needed from the chip,
specifically its square wave output and its battery-backed RAM.

## Documentation
@todo Mostly comments in `RealTimeClockDS1307.h`

## Examples (in /examples folder)

- `RealTimeClockDS1307_Test.pde` allow you to turn the clock on/off,
set date/time, set 12/24h, [de]activate the square wave, and
read/write memory from the Serial Monitor.

- `RealTimeClockDS1307.fz` is a Fritzing breadboard layout showing
the basic hookup of the Sparkfun RTC module to an Arduino. Included
is an optional resistor+LED to show the square wave (note that it's
an open drain, so you hook up to it rather differently than, say, 
pin 13).

## Changelog

Version 0.94    -- changed getDate() to getDay() and
                   setDate() to setDay() and updated
                   keywords.txt and the example
                   by Sudar & Andreas Giemza (hurik)

Version 0.93    -- added keywords.txt for syntax highlighting
                   by Andreas Giemza (hurik)
Version 0.92 RC -- Updated for Arduino 1.00; testing with
                   Andreas Giemza (hurik)
Version 0.91    -- added multi-byte read/write
Version 0.9 RC  -- initial release

using any of their code):
